TensorFlow Lego
===============

Overview
--------
This is yet another wrapper for building neural networks in using
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The code is mainly used for quickly
building neural networks in some of my other projects.


Examples
--------
Many of the tests in `tflego/` give examples of how to use the models.


Testing
-------
Run `make test` to run unit tests.
